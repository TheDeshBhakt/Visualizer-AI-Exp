# Data Visualization Experiments

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to understand the fundamentals of data visualization. The notebooks cover a range of popular Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, and provide a solid foundation for developers/students to build upon.

## Notebooks

The repository is organized into the following notebooks:

*   **1. Matplotlib Visualizations:** This notebook introduces the basics of Matplotlib, the most widely used data visualization library in Python. It covers fundamental plots such as line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms.

*   **2. Seaborn Visualizations:** This notebook explores Seaborn, a high-level data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It focuses on statistical plots and demonstrates how to create more complex and aesthetically pleasing visualizations with ease.

*   **3. Statistical Visualizations:** This notebook delves into advanced statistical visualizations, including heatmaps, pair plots, violin plots, and facet grids. It's designed for students who want to gain a deeper understanding of their data and uncover hidden patterns.

*   **4. Plotly Visualizations:** This notebook introduces Plotly, a powerful library for creating interactive and web-based visualizations. It covers the basics of creating interactive plots and provides a glimpse into the world of interactive data exploration.

## How to Use the Notebooks

To get started, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. If you don't have them installed, we recommend downloading the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which includes both.

Once you have everything set up, you can clone this repository to your local machine and open the notebooks in Jupyter. We recommend going through the notebooks in order, as they build upon each other.

## Contributions
